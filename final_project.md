# Final Project
* The final project can be done in groups or individualy. 
* Your goal is to redesign the existing Emergency Department at the USZ using evidence-based design literature and the tools learned in class (the virtual reality walkthrough and spatial simulation tools).

## Part 1: Formulating your research questions 
* Each project should formulate one or more research questions and several design hypotheses.
* The research question should focus on the relationship between the architectural design and users’ behavior or experience in the ED. Try to ground your question in a problem or   opportunity you identified when conducting exc3. What can be improved? What is problematic in the current ED?
* For instance:
  * How can the design of the emergency department layout improve patients' exposure to outdoor view and still reduce nurses’ walking distances?
  * How can the design of the emergency department layout improve staff collaboration? 
  * How can the design of the emergency department layout improve patient flow? 
  * How can the design of the emergency department layout improve wayfinding? 

## Part 2: Setting up your design hypotheses
* Once you have defined your research questions, turn to the evidence-based design literature (consult with us as well) to develop a design hypothesis, for instance:
  * By increasing the architectural differentiation at decision points, wayfinding would be made more efficient, resulting in people finding their way faster to typical               destinations such as the nurse station or main waiting area.
  * By increasing visibility at decision points, wayfinding would be made more efficient, resulting in people finding their way faster to typical destinations such as the nurse       station or main waiting area.

## Part 3: Generating design variations
* Once you formulated your research questions and design hypotheses, suggest and implement 2 design variations of the existing ED. Your design variations should be as systematic     as possible. For instance, if ‘increased visibility’ is your design strategy, try to have 3 conditions: the existing ED, the ED with medium visibility, and the ED with high       visibility.
* In the crits left you will present your research question and design variations to us and received feedback in a group tutorial manner .
* Once your design variations are finalized, prepare the following matrix that will be used by each group to analyze the design with respect to the hypotheses set:

| Layout/performance criteria | Wayfinding efficiency (measured using ICD and in VR) | Staff collaboration (measured using SCI) | Layout efficiency (measured using YTI) | Patients’ visual  exposure to outdoor view (measured using VR) |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Existing ED | Your hypothesis | Your hypothesis | Your hypothesis | Your hypothesis |
| Redesigned ED (option a) | Your hypothesis | Your hypothesis | Your hypothesis | Your hypothesis |
| Redesigned ED (option b) | Your hypothesis | Your hypothesis | Your hypothesis | Your hypothesis |

* This table is important as it provides a guide to how you evaluate your design.
* Make sure you set performance criteria that you can measure using the tools provided.

## Part 4: Running the analysis 
* Conduct the analysis using the tools learned in class.
* Did you confirm or reject your hypotheses?
* Is there another design that could have achieved better performance? If so, generate it and redo the analysis.

## Part 5: Presenting your findings
* Each student/group will have 25 minutes to present the project to external guests, the ED team and healthcare architects.
* You can present the project in any way you find useful, from a presentation to a video.

the final date of the presentations will be set in collaboration with students (we will send you a Doodle).
