# Final presentation requirements  

* The final project will be a team-based project (3-4 students in each team)
* Using evidence-based design literature (drawing from 5 papers at least) outline current challenges of hospital design and identify 3 key occupancy-related performance indicators that could guide hospital design to tackle these challenges(e.g., patient supervision, natural views from patient bed, nursed walking distances).
* Creatively apply ALL the analysis tools learned in class to cross-compare typologies for those 3 performance indicators (each group should have a minimum of 6 typologies, based on your prior exercises), resulting in a ranking of typologies for each performance indicator 
* Based on this analysis, hypothesise which design actions could improve performance across all three indicators and design one or more novel typologies that you believe will outperform the existing typologies 
* Analyse the performance of your new typology and evaluate it compared to the existing typologies, identifying tradeoffs and opportunities.
