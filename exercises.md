## Evidence-Based Design Cards (on Miro)
Based on your reading, prepare two pairs of cards for our **Evidence-Based Design for Healthcare Card Deck**. 
The instructions and template for making the card (as well as an example of two cards) are in the Miro board (link provided via email).
You can see two screenshots from the Miroboard below.
