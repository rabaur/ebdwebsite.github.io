## 2. Installing Unity3D

_Unity3D_ is available for a wide range of platforms (Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, …). It is best to install Unity3D on your native operating system (the one you are usually running) to have the most performance. 

Visit [https://unity3d.com/de/get-unity/download](https://unity3d.com/de/get-unity/download) and choose _Download Unity Hub_. _Unity Hub_ is a program that can manage all your Unity versions and projects.

Once Unity Hub is installed, open and choose: _Installs_ → _Add_ → _2019.4.** LTS_. **It is important to install this exact version**. It will now begin to download the Unity version.

Once completed, you will be able to create a new project with the Unity version you have just downloaded.

### Trouble with licenses? 
In that case, click “manage licenses” on the bottom of the UnityHub window, create an account, and choose the licencing-option _personal_. After that, you will be able to use Unity3D without restrictions.
