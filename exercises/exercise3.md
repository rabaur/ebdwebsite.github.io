#  Exc3: Comparing users’ spatial experience across Emergency Department Layouts 


![Comparing users’ spatial experience across Emergency Department Layouts ](/assets/images/Exc3.png)



## Overview

Exc3: compare users’ experience for the same task/s across typologies (in pairs) , 
Team tutorials: 9.11.22 Final submission in class: 16.11.22

Stages of the exercise: 

1. Define 1-2 tasks and ask 5 different participants to perform these tasks in each of the ED layouts you have modelled (do consider giving them a brief training on how to move in VR before you start, but not in the layout that you're testing). 

2. Analyse the results (as you learned in class) using the data collected in each trial performed by a single participant in each layout – did participants in each layout behave similarly? 

3. Calculate the average experience for all participants in each layout. 
How is the user experience afforded by each layout different?

4. Link your findings with scientific evidence:  can this type of individual experience (e.g., wayfinding efficiency) affect organisational outcomes (e.g., costs, medical errors)   

5. The step-by-step tutorial is recorded in the following videos, instricting you on how to setup your scene and run the experiment: 


### Submission Materials
A 10 slide presentation including your experiment setup, instruction for participants, video capture of selected trials, analysis of results using the visualisation and summary data including legends, comparison of experience across layouts, a critical slide linking your findings back to scientific evidence (how does this individual experience may contribute to organisational outcomes).

# Step-by-step Tutorial

Please find the Unity Project [here](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/zfszG6nJkxDiscZ)

Then, follow these steps:
- Download the Unity Project
- Unzip it 
- Open Unity Hub
- In the tab "Project", select "Add"
- Search the project you have just downloaded and indicate its location
- Open the project. It will run the setup. If you are on a Windows, agree to "Switch Target"
- The Unity version of this example project (as shown in class) is 2021.3.11f1 so make sure you install it on Unity hub
