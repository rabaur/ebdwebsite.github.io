#  Exercise 2: Comparing Users’ Wayfinding across Hospital Typologies

## Overview

- The **goal** of this exercise is to analyze **how** the **configuration** of different hospital typologies **affects wayfinding performance** and experience.
- To complete the exercise you need to:
    - Choose two hospital layouts
    - Hypothesize (based on your intuition): Which layout  would support more efficient wayfinding? Why?
    - Complete Part 1: Generate a 3D model for each typology (Rhino, VisualARQ) and import it into Unity3D
    - Complete Part 2: Conduct a small scall behavioural experiment to assess differences in wayfinding between the two typologies
    - Complete Part 3: Critically analyse participants’ wayfinding behaviour using the data collected and try to relate the observed differences/similarities between typologies to the configuration of the environment

## Part 1: Generate a 3D Model for each Typology and Import it into Unity
### Due date: 17.02.2022, 23:59
- Choose and model 2 hospital typologies
- To model the layouts we will use VisualArq for Rhino. If you prefer to use another modelling software, you can do so.
However, note that you will need to use Rhino in future exercises, so some early experience might be beneficial.
- A tutorial showing how to model a floor plan from an image using visualarq can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NVp7wVHzlMYqUnkfs7qSa9iyu5t3iO9D/view)
- For additional VisualARQ tutorials, please visit [this link](https://www.visualarq.com/learn/videos/)
- Export both typologies from Rhino as .fbx files (or another format that is accepted by Unity3D) by following these steps:

- Create a fresh Unity project by following these steps:

- Import the .fbx files (or the other format you have chosen) into the new Unity project by following these steps.

- Drag and drop the layouts into the scene and take a screenshot from the resulting scene.

### Submission Materials
- Upload screenshot of Unity3D scene to Miro board (link will be sent via email).

# Part 2 & 3: VR Experiment
