# Exercise 2

## 1. Model the typology
* 2D orthographic floorplan
* Possible resources: List of typologies but also choose from other databases.
* Do & Dont's (with images)

## 2. Generating the Measures

> IMPORTANT: In use of these tools ... -> polybox.ch

* Brief overview on Grasshopper:

### 2.1 Set the Inputs

### 2.2 Output 1: Medial Axis
* Short description (what is it)? This should include explanations about the types of segments.
* Refer to 3 for general export settings.

### 2.3 Output 2: Graph
* Short description.
* (Convex partitioning overlayed with the) nodes and edges of the graph.
* Refer to 3 for general export settings.

### 2.4 Labelling the graph
* Baking the graph geometry.
* Assigning the 3D points (correspond to nodes) to the different semantic labels.

### 2.4 Output 3: ICD
* Short description (reference to paper).
* Here display graph with numbers indicating the degree.
* Render with ICD displayed on the side.

### 2.5 Output 4: YTI
* Short description (reference to paper).
* Check the YTI setting.
* Render with YTI displayed on the side.

### 2.6 Output 5: SCI
* Short description (reference to paper).
* Check the SCI setting.
* Render with SCI displayed on the side.

## 3. Your output
Here we explain how you need to render.

### 3.1 Viewport definitions
* Align center of viewport with center of floorplan.
* Rendering mode arctic (-> customize settings with rendering)

### 3.2 Rendering and exporting
* ViewCaptureToFile
* Constrain resolution, dpi etc.
* Upload the images named correctly to polybox.
* Download this .md file and fill in the details.
